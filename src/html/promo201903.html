        <p>
          Recently I was approached by a number of companies which have shown
          interest in <strong>buying</strong> the
          Poloniexâ„¢ Ninja Chrome Extension.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first glance, this is funny, since the whole thing is open source
          and available on GitHub since the very beginning.
        </p>

        <p>Essentially they're interested in buying the rights for pushing
        updates to the Chrome web store and obviously want access to you guys -
        my loyal user base.</p>

        <p><strong>I am not down with this.</strong></p>

        <p>There will be no such sale. I have decided instead to let you guys
        finally show support, be it as little as 0.002 BTC. However symbolical,
        this means much more to me than getting a one-time cash injection from
        a shady and aggressive marketing company which would likely exploit the
        community. Not gonna happen.</p>

        <p>There you have it. PoloNinja is truly free, now and forever.</p>
